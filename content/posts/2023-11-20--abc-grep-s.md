Use the `-s` flag for **suppressing**â€‹ error messages about unreadable file or files that don't exist.
 
Consider a `test.txt` file with the following content:
```
sad
happy
awake
coffee
work
school
```

Searching for "happy" with the `-s` flag doesn't really do anything special since `test.txt` does in fact exist.
```
$ grep -s "happy" test.txt
happy
```

Suppose there was a typo and we typed `best.txt` instead, we would see an error:
```
$ grep "happy" best.txt
grep: best.txt: No such file or directory
```

The `-s` flag will suppress that error:
```
$ grep -s "happy" best.txt
```
