Use the `-m` flag to set the **max** number of lines found for a matching pattern.

Let's return to our `numbers.txt` file and duplicate the content so that we have 5 lines:
```
123456789
123456789
123456789
123456789
123456789
```

If we wanted to search for the pattern `345`, we would run:
```
$ grep "345" numbers.txt
123456789
123456789
123456789
123456789
123456789
```
As expected, the `grep` command will return every line with `345` in it.
Add the `-m` flag to limit it to the max number you define:
```
grep -m 3 "345" numbers.txt
123456789
123456789
123456789
```
