Use the `-i` flag to ignore caseâ€‹ in the results.

Let's return back to our handy `test.txt` file and add "Happy" to the end:
```
sad
happy
awake
coffee
work
school
Happy
```

To ignore case differences run:
```
$ grep -i "happy" test.txt
happy 
Happy
```
The uppercase variant is also an "ignore" flag, but this time we are ignoring binary files.
So if the current directory with `test.txt`, also contained `test.pdf`, the following would ignore the pdf file:
```
$ grep -I "happy" *
test.txt:happy
```
