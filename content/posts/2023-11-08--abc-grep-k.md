K

As many flags the grep command has, `-K` is **not** one of them.
In fact if you try, you will see the following error:
```
$ grep -K
grep: invalid option -- 'K'
Usage: grep [OPTION]... PATTERNS [FILE]...
Try 'grep --help' for more information.
```
I thought this would be a good opportunity to see how to use `grep` with errors.
Suppose we want to look for the word "information". How would we do that?

Let's take a look at the pipe operator `|` which can take the output of one command as the input of the next.  Remember our `test.txt` file with the following content:
```
sad
happy
awake
coffee
work
school
```

Another way to search for "happy" is like this:
```
cat test.txt | grep "happy"
happy
```
In other words, we are taking the *output* of `cat test.txt` and using that as the *input* for `grep happy`.  

So let's try with our `grep` error:
```
$ grep -K | grep "information"
```

Unfortunately, this doesn't work because `grep -K` produces an error stream.  It can be tricky to understand at first but errors are treated differently than successful output.  The `grep` command can operate on successful output (called standard out), but can't use error output.  We want to redirect the error to standard out (i.e. make the error something `grep` can operate on) and `2>&1` is how we do that.

Putting it all together, this is how we would search for terms in the `grep` error:
```
$ grep -K 2>&1 | grep "information"
Try 'grep --help' for more information.
```
