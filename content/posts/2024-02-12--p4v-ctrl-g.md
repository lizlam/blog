If you have been looking for a quick way to open up specs in P4V, the Go To Spec modal
is likely the thing you need.  You can navigate to this modal by clicking on **Search** | **Go To...** or by hitting the **CTRL** + **G** shortcut.

This is what I use when I need to quickly lookup a changelist number but it supports searching for the following specs as well:
* Branch Mapping
* Label
* Workspace
* User
* Job
