Welcome to The ABC's of p4 grep!  

Here we will explore the different flags for the p4 grep command. 

B
--
Much like the regular `grep`, use the `-B` flag to show the lines *before* the matching search term is found.

Suppose you have a file named `test.txt` with the following content:
```
sad
happy
awake
coffee
work
school
```

You would search for the word "happy" like this:
```
$ grep -e happy test.txt
//depot/test.txt#6:happy
```

To see the first line before happy, execute the following:
```
$ grep -B 1 -e happy test.txt
//depot/test.txt#6-sad
//depot/test.txt#6:happy
```
