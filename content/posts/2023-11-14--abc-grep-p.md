P

Use the `-P` flag when using Perl compatible regular expressions as the match pattern.

Let's recall our `test.txt` file with the following content:
```
sad
happy
awake
coffee
work
school
```

Let's add a line with digits.
```
$ echo "3.14" >> test.txt
$ cat test.txt
sad
happy
awake
coffee
work
school
3.14
```

In Perl, `\d` is a regular expression that matches on numerical digits.

Let's try executing a grep command with it.
```
$ grep "\d" test.txt
sad
```

As you can see, there is a match on the literal `d` and the `grep` command did not match on a digit.

Running the command with the `-P` flag should do the trick:
```
$ grep -P "\d" test.txt
3.14
```
