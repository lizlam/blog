Use the `-J` flag to decompress `bzip2` files before searching.

Let's return back to our simple `test.txt` file with the following content:
```
sad
happy
awake
coffee
work
school
```
To compress the `test.txt` file using `bzip2` run:
```
$ bzip2 test.txt
```
This is a bit of silly example since `test.txt` is so small that compressing it will actually make it bigger, but you should now see a compressed `test.txt.bz2` file.

If you look inside `test.txt.bz2` you will see nothing but gobbly gook (yes, that's the technical term).
As you can probably imagine, our normal way of searching for the word "happy" will not work.
```
$ cat test.txt.bz2
BZh91AY&SY7PA?/LØ  "&??z?4)??rG???R[?K=li@???H?
???%
$ grep "happy" test.txt.bz2 
```

This is where the `-J` flag comes in:
```
$ grep -J "happy' test.txt.bz2
happy
```
