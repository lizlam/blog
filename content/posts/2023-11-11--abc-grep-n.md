We have arrived to a flag that I pretty much use all the time.
The `-n` shows you the line **number**â€‹ of the found search pattern.

Ok, back to our `test.txt` file with the following content:
```
sad
happy
awake
coffee
work
school
```

Using the `-n` flag we can find exactly which line "coffee" is on:
```
$ grep -n "coffee" test.txt
4:coffee
```
