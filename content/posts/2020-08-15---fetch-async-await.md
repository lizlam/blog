Sometimes the best way to explain something to someone is to just show them an example.  This was the case when a couple of coworkers had some confusion around using `async`/`await`.  

After verbally explaining, I opened up my web console and gave them a quick example.  This seemed to clarify their understanding.  

I will share the example here in case it's helpful to anyone else.

*SIDE NOTE: This also made me think about how just playing around in the web console is a great way to learn of JavaScript.  It's also an easy way to share knowledge because anyone can just copy what you have into their own web console.*
