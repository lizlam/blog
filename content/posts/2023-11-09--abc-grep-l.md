Use the `-L` flag to list the files that does **not** contain the search term.

Let's return back to our simple `test.txt` file with the following content:
```
sad
happy
awake
coffee
work
school
```

Let's also create a file `numbers.txt` with different content:
```
$ echo 123456789 > numbers.txt
```

In order to see which file does **not** contain the numbers, run:
```
$ grep -L 12345 *
test.txt
```

Want to see the files that **do** contain the numbers? Use the `-l` flag:
```
$ grep -l 12345 *
numbers.txt
```
