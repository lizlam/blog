V

Use the `-v`​ flag to **invert**​ what is being matched.  In other words, give me the opposite of what I am trying to search for.

Let's go back to our `test.txt` file with the following content:
```
sad
happy
awake
coffee
work
school
```

As before, if we wanted to search for "happy" we would do the following:
```
$ grep "happy" test.txt
happy
```

Using the `-v` flag will give us all the lines that **do not**​ contain the word "happy".
```
$ grep -v "happy" test.txt
sad
awake
coffee
work
school
```

Use `-V` to print out the version of grep.
```
$ grep -V
