C

Use the `-C` flag to show the lines of *context* around the matching search term.  This is basically the same as using `-A` and `-B` together.

Let's return back to our file `test.txt` with the following content:
```
sad
happy
awake
coffee
work
school
```

As before, we would search for the word "happy" like this:
```
$ grep "happy" test.txt
happy
```

To see the first line before and after happy, execute the following:
```
$ grep -C 1 "happy" test.txt
sad
happy
awake
```

The lowercase version of this flag (`-c`) is also pretty useful.   This will show the number of lines that the matching term shows up in.

For example:
```
grep -c "happy" test.txt
1
```

Let's add another happy line and try the flag again:
```
echo "happy" >> test.txt
grep -c "happy" test.txt
2
```

It's important to note that `-c` will only return the number of lines.  If we added another line with multiple "happy" words, it will only be counted once.
```
echo "happy happy happy" >> test.txt
grep -c "happy" test.txt
3 
```
