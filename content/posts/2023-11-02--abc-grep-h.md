H

Use the `-H` flag to show the filename *header*â€‹ in the results.

Let's return back to our handy `test.txt` file with the following content:
```
sad
happy
awake
coffee
work
school
```

To see the filename header, run:
```
$ grep -H "awake" test.txt
test.txt:awake
```

This is the default when searching through multiple files.  Let's make a copy of `test.txt` and run the grep command for both files.
```
$ cp test.txt test2.txt
$ grep "awake" test*.txt
test.txt:awake
test2.txt:awake
```

Use `-h` if you explicitly don't want to see the headers:
```
$ grep -h "awake test*.txt
awake
awake
```
