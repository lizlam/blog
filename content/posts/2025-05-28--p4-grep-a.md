Welcome to The ABC's of p4 grep!  

Here we will explore the different flags for the p4 grep commands. 

Let's start! 

A
--
Much like the regular `grep`, use the `-A` flag to show the lines *after* the matching search term is found.

Suppose you have a file named `test.txt` with the following content:
```
sad
happy
awake
coffee
work
school
```

You would search for the word "happy" like this:
```
$ grep -e happy test.txt
//depot/test.txt#6:happy
```

To see the first 2 lines after happy, execute the following:
```
$ grep -A 2 -e happy test.txt
//depot/test.txt#6:happy
//depot/test.txt#6-awake
//depot/test.txt#6-coffee
```

Now the lowercase `-a` flag stands for "all revisions". `p4 grep` by default
only greps through the latest revision.

Suppose we have a `helloworld.txt` file with the following content:
```
p4 print helloworld.txt
//depot/helloworld.txt#2 - edit change 9 (text)
Hello world!
```
Let's search for the term "earth":
```
p4 grep -e earth helloworld.txt
```

Nothing. Well, duh! Didn't you see above that the content of the file is `Hello world`!
This is true for the latest revision (#2), but we can `p4 print` the first revision to reveal:
```
p4 print helloworld.txt#1
//depot/helloworld.txt#1 - add change 8 (text)
Hello earth!
```
So the word "earth" *was* in the file, this is where the `-a` flag comes in handy.

```
p4 grep -a -e earth helloworld.txt
//depot/helloworld.txt#1:Hello earth!
```

So use `-a` when searching for a term in all the revisions of a file.
