The [*Making of Prince of Persia*](https://www.jordanmechner.com/en/books/journals/?utm_source=arador.com) is just as good as it's [predecessor](https://www.jordanmechner.com/en/books/the-making-of-karateka/).  
    
The journals continue with Jordan Mechner as a young adult and out of college.  Much like *The Making of Karateka*, Mechner give fascinating insight into the 
early years of video game development.     

As a Prince of Persia fan, I just ate up all the details on how this iconic game made it to my PC as a little girl.  The details did not disappoint!

A must read for for any [Prince of Persia](https://archive.org/details/prince_of_persia_1990) fan!
