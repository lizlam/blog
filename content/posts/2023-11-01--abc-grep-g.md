Use the `-G` flag to make your search pattern behave like a basic regular expressionâ€‹.
This is like a limited [`-e` flag](https://grepliz.netlify.app/posts/abcs-grep-e) and probably not as useful in comparison.

The grep man pages says it forces "grep to behave as traditional grep".
This leads me to believe this was probably a flag to support backward compatibility.
