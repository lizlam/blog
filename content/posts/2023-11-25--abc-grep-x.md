Use the `-x`â€‹ flag to match on an entire line.

Let's go back to our `test.txt` file and add a sentence at the end:
```
sad
happy
awake
coffee
work
school
I love coffee.
```

If we wanted to search for "coffee" we would do the following:
```
$ grep "coffee" test.txt
coffee
I love coffee.
```

As expected, we get both lines that contain the word "coffee".

Let's try again with the `-x` flag.
```
$ grep -x "coffee" test.txt
coffee
$ grep -x "I love coffee." test.txt
I love coffee.
```

As you can see, using the `-x` flag only matches on the entire line.
