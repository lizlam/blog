B

Use the `-B` flag to show the lines *before* the matching search term is found.

Remember our file `test.txt` with the following content:
```
sad
happy
awake
coffee
work
school
```

As before, we would search for the word "happy" like this:
```
$ grep "happy" test.txt
happy
```

To see the first line before happy, execute the following:
```
$ grep -B 1 "happy" test.txt
sad
happy
```
