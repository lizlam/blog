Use the `-D`  or `-d` flag to describe the action of what to do with *devices* and *directories* respectively.  There are three types of actions: **read**, **skip** and **recurse**.  The **skip** action is the default.

Let's take a look with directories since it will be easier to demonstrate.
Suppose you have a file `readme.txt`​ in your current directory with the content:
```
Hello all!
```

Now you also have a subdirectory called `alpha`​ containing a file named `alpha.txt​` with the following content:
```
// Located in ./alpha/alpha.txt
Hello alpha!
```

In order to search through all the files in the current directory for a matching search term we use an **asterisk**.  For example:
```
$ grep "Hello" *
grep: alpha: Is a directory
readme.txt:Hello all!
```

This is essentially the same as using `-d`​ with **read** as the action.

```
$ grep -d read "Hello" *
grep: alpha: Is a directory
readme.txt:Hello all!
```

Use the **skip** action to skip directories:

```
$ grep -d skip "Hello" *
readme.txt:Hello all!
```

Use the **recurse** action to recursively search through the directories:
```
$ grep -d recurse "Hello" *
alpha/alpha.txt:Hello alpha!
readme.txt:Hello all!
```
