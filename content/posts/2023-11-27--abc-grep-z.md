Z

The `-Z`​ flag will output the zero byte when used in combination with a flag that outputs the file name on a search match.​  Ok, what does that mean?

Let's take a look at our `test.txt` file with the following content:
```
sad
happy
awake
coffee
work
school
```

If we wanted to list all the file names with the pattern "happy" in it, we would do the following:
```
$ grep -l "happy" *
test.txt
$
```

Note the newline after `test.txt` and the location of the cursor.

Using the -Z flag will add a zero byte instead of a newline, putting the cursor directly after file name.
```
$ grep -lZ "happy" *
test.txt:happy$
```
