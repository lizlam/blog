Q

Use the `-q` flag for **quiet**​ mode.  In command line world, "quiet" usually means "don't print stuff to the screen".  This may seem weird since so many of the examples we have ​seen so far show results to the screen.  How do we know if the pattern was found?  We can do so by inspecting the exit status.       

Let's return to our `test.txt` file with the following content:
```
sad
happy
awake
coffee
work
school
```

Let's search for "happy" with the `-q` flag and then look at the exit status:
```
$ grep -q "happy" test.txt
$ echo $?
0
```

An exit status of 0 means success.  It's also important to note that the grep command is exiting immediately after finding the first occurrence of "happy" and it will not continue.

Let's try again with a term that is not in `test.txt`:
```
$ grep -q "bright" test.txt
$ echo $?
1
```

An exit status of 1 means that the term was not found in the file.
