Use the `-E` or `-e` flag to treat your search term as a regular expression.  The lowercase `-e` is used for *basic* regular expressions which includes: `^$.[]*`.
The uppercase `-E` includes the *extended* regular expressions: `(){}?~|`.

Let's go back to our file `test.txt` with the following content:
```
sad
happy
awake
coffee
work
school
```

Suppose we wanted to use a regular expression that searches for all the words that ends in "e".  We would do something like this:
```
$ grep -e "e$" test.txt
awake
coffee
```

In reality, this already happens by default.  You could easily run the same `grep` command without the `-e` flag and get the same results.  The real power is being able to use `-e` multiple times to construct the perfect search.  Let's say we wanted to search for all words that end in "e" *or* starts with "w".

We could accomplish that like this:
```
$ grep -e "e$" -e "^w" test.txt
awake
coffee
work
```

If you wanted to use the *extended* regular expressions like the `|` symbol, you must use `-E`.
For example this is the search for lines with "sad" or "happy":
```
$ grep -E "sad|happy" test.txt
sad
happy
```

Using -e with the above would return zero rows.
