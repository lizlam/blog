Hello World! I'm back to talk to about my favorite editor.  

Did you know that you are not just restricted to editing in `vim`?  

![explore and delete files in vim](/media/vim-explore-delete.gif)

You can explore your current directory by hitting `:Ex`. 
 
This will show a list view of your files and you can navigate up (`j`) or down (`k`) with the usual methods.    

You can also delete a file by hitting: `SHIFT` + `D` and confirming with `y`.

To go back to editing, select the file and hit `ENTER`.
