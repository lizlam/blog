I just finished reading [*The Making of Karateka: Journals 1982-1985*](https://www.jordanmechner.com/en/books/the-making-of-karateka/) by Jordan Mechner.
Mechner who is probably most well known for his game [Prince of Persia](https://archive.org/details/prince_of_persia_1990), began his
publishing career with Karateka.  These journals tell his story in a unique and genuine way.  At just 17, he is pushing himself to get into the video game industry by writing computer games on his Apple II.  

I really loved this book.  It was a great insight into the programming culture of the early 1980's and what the video game landscape looked like.  I have met so many people who got into programming because of video games and it is interesting to see how that played out for Mechner.

I never played Karateka but I was a big Prince of Persia fan which prompted me to pick up both this book and its sequel, [*The Making of Prince of Persia*](https://www.jordanmechner.com/en/books/journals/).

*The Making of Karateka* is definitely a great read and inspiring.  There were so many things that impressed me.  I loved how even at a young age, Mechner was focused on chasing after his dream of creating a great game.  That he was able to focus on it for as long as he did.  That he didn't flunk all his classes!  That a 17 year old would even commit to writing journals like this.

It gave me a lot to think about.

As all good books do.
