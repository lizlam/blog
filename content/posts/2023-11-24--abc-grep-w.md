W

Use the `-w`â€‹ flag to match on *whole words*.

Recall our `test.txt` file with the following content:
```
sad
happy
awake
coffee
work
school
```

Suppose we want to search for "wake". We would do the following:
```
$ grep "wake" test.txt
awake
```

Using the `-w` flag will give us all the lines that contain "wake" as
a whole word and not just a part of word.
```
$ grep -w "wake" test.txt
```

In this case, the `grep` command returns nothing.
