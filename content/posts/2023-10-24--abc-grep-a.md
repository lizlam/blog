Welcome to The ABC's of grep!  

Here we will explore the different flags for our beloved command and give it the accolades it deserves.  

Let's start! 

A
--
Use the `-A` flag to show the lines *after* the matching search term is found.

Suppose you have a file named `test.txt` with the following content:
```
sad
happy
awake
coffee
work
school
```

You would search for the word "happy" like this:
```
$ grep "happy" test.txt
happy
```

To see the first 2 lines after happy, execute the following:
```
$ grep -A 2 "happy" test.txt
happy
awake
coffee
```
