R

Use the `-r` and `-R` flag to **recursively**â€‹ search through directories. 
The only difference between the two is `-R` will follow symlinks in subdirectories.

Let's suppose we have a subdirectory called `alpha` with a file
named `alpha.txt` that contained the following:
```
// Located in ./alpha/alpha.txt
Hello alpha!
```

Use an **asterisk** to search through all files in the current directory.

```
$ grep "Hello" *
grep: alpha: Is a directory
```

Since `alpha` is a directory, use the `-R` flag to recursively search through it.

```
$ grep -R "Hello" *
alpha/alpha.txt:Hello alpha!
```
