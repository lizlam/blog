T

Use the `-T` flag to add a **tab** before the actual line of content.  This flag is most useful when used with a flag that outputs information before the results.  
 
Consider a `test.txt` file with the following content:
```
sad
happy
awake
coffee
work
school
```

Searching for "happy" with the `-n` flag will output the line number before the actual content results.
```
$ grep -n "happy" test.txt
2:happy
```

Adding the `-T` flag will add a tab between the line number and content:
```
$ grep -Tn "happy" test.txt
 2:    happy 
```

Using the `-T` flag with different flags will act a little differently depending on the output, but just know this flag helps the results look a little cleaner.
