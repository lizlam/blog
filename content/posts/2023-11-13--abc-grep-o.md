Use the `-o` flag to â€‹**only** see the part of pattern you are interested in.  

Let's return to our handy dandy `test.txt` file with the following content:
```
sad
happy
awake
coffee
work
school
```

If we grep for "wake" we will see the entire line:
```
$ grep "wake" test.txt
awake
```

Using the `-o` flag, the output is exactly what we are searching for:
```
$ grep -o "wake" test.txt
wake
```
